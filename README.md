# Actionpanel Widget Styles

You can start from these stylesheets to apply custom styling to your [Actionpanel](https://action-panel.com) widgets.

Choose the *Apply only basic CSS* option in *Edit Widget -> Design -> Advanced settings* to stop the JavaScript adding style attributes.
To override the basic css, target the widget by its id or with `body .actionpanel-widget`.
